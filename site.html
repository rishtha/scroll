                   <p>
                   I am currently pursuing my pre final year of Computer Science 
                   Engineering at Sathyabama Institute 
                   of Science and Technology. Technology 
                   changing and evolving very fast and I am 
                   just a kid trying to keep up with the new ones.
                   <!-- I started coding in my 1st year of college and 
                   started to show more interest towards it and decided 
                   to pursue my career in same field, since 
                   then I have attended various workshops 
                   on different domain to find my area of expertise.
                   I am interested in few different domains 
                   in computer science and one of which is web developing. -->
                   Apart from programming I either read books or teach 
                   myself how to play keyboard in my free time.
